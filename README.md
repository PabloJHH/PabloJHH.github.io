I have 3 years of experience in project management. I’ve worked in business transformation projects with SAP, Data Center Infrastructure implementation and Core Banking Software consulting. I’m mainly focused on IT projects but I’m open to new opportunities.
I'm very passionate about project management and methodology, I have good communication skills and leadership with a high capacity to adopt to change.
